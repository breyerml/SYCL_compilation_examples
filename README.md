# SYCL_compilation_examples

Compilation examples using CMake and normal make for the two major SYCL implementations: AdaptiveCpp from the University of Heidelberg and Intel's icpx.

Example (lua) modulefiles for lmod can be found in the `.modulefiles` directory. Note that the root paths for the respective SYCL implementations must be changed according to your installation.
